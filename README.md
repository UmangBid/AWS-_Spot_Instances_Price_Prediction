This project involves building a predictive application to forecast AWS Spot Instance prices, helping optimize cloud cost management. The application processes over 1 million data points per region using Apache Spark and employs advanced regression techniques, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Achieved a 6.23% Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) by analyzing factors like datetime, region, operating system, and instance type. Data insights and trends are visualized with Matplotlib and Plotly, enabling actionable decisions for real-time resource allocation and cost savings.
